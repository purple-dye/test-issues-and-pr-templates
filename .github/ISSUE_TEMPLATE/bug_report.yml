        Thank you for reporting an issue :pray:.

        This issue tracker is for reporting bugs of PurpleDye components found when using them in a PurpleDye workspace (canvas): https://app.purpledye.io/?public-dashboards=all.
        If you have a question about how to achieve something and are struggling, please join the PurpleDye discord: https://discord.com/invite/aUTgv2Yc4u.
